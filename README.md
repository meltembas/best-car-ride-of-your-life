# 🚚 The Best Car Ride of Your Life

**A low-poly physics playground on wheels.**

## 📦 About The Project
This isn't just a driving simulator; it's a test of chaos. I built this in Unity to experiment with vehicle dynamics and rigid body physics.

The premise is simple: you are a delivery truck on a lonely road filled with obstacles. You can drive carefully and weave through the crates... or you can plow right through them and watch the physics engine do its work.

**Core Features:**
* **Satisfying Physics:** Every crate and barrier reacts to impact. Smash them, tip them over, or push them off the road.
* **Low-Poly Aesthetic:** Clean, stylized visuals for a smooth experience.
* **Reactive Environment:** The world reacts to your driving style.

## 🕹️ Controls
Standard **WASD** movement. You know the drill.
* *Drive fast, hit hard (or don't).*

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Engine:** Unity 3D
* **Scripting:** C#
* **Physics:** Unity Rigidbody & Colliders

## 🚀 Getting Started
1.  Clone the repo.
2.  Open the project in Unity (Version 202x.x).
3.  Hit **Play** and start driving.

> **Dev Note:** This project currently runs on the legacy Input Manager. If the console warns you about the new Input System package, you can safely ignore it or switch the settings to "Both."
